# Python--snake
 
Python implementation of the game Snake.

The program takes input from keyboard, in console, as follows:

- size of the board and number of apples in the beginning of the game
- move (move snake 1 square in the current direction)
- left (change direction of movement and move snake 1 square to the left)
- right (change direction of movement and move snake 1 square to the right)
- up (change direction of movement and move snake 1 square up)
- down (change direction of movement and move snake 1 square down)

The snake's body is represented as `+` symbols, and its head is represented as `*`. The apples on the board are represented as `a`.

When the snake eats an apple, its body grows by one unit.

	This program was realised during the practical test taken for the Fundamentals of Programming course, during Semester 1.
